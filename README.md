### Description

Rick's codebank is a simple application which, I believe, would be a good learning tool for beginners. When I was first starting out with VB it was nearly impossible to find a complete working project to learn from. Books and manuals talk all around a subject but never really show you how to do anything practical. They give you a few snippets of code, but never a project complete enough to give you the big picture.
 
### More Info
 
This is a complete application released into the public domain.
